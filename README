serverudp.py and clientudp.py are UDP implementations
rcmdd.py and rcmd.py are TCP implementations

Run server and client with python3. Run server first, then client
Only input one-input commands (i.e. do not put something like 'ls -l')
Temporary file gets written into server, not client, which only outputs the result.
